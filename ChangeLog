******************************* Version 0.9.1  *********************************

	Added port of Pixel City, originally by Shamus Young,
http://code.google.com/p/pixelcity/
	Replaced methods deprecated by ImageMagick.

******************************* Version 0.9.0  *********************************

	Added port of drempels, originally by Ryan M. Geiss,
http://www.geisswerks.com/about_drempels.html
	Added new saver feedback by Tugrul Galatali.
	Added support for DPMS to idle the saver when the display isn't on.
	Fixed brown paper bag bug in hyperspace.
	Added two new presets to flocks inspired by Matt Richard's Wavy Gravy on
openprocessing.org
	Tweaked hufo_smoke to avoid flat flame effect.
	Fixed unknown argument segfault in lattice.
	Switched matrixview's main character array to vertex arrays, which helps
significantly on older nVidia hardware.
	hyperspace and drempels have command line arguments to disable use of
shaders in case they behave unexpectedly.
	Minor changes to fix builds on other platforms.

******************************* Version 0.8.3 *********************************

	New screen saver Lorenz contributed by Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
	Fix for SF #2673397 by changing =='s to >='s in widthChange update logic,
otherwise non-sense values for interpolation would wreak havoc. Also changed for
xyzChange.

******************************* Version 0.8.2 *********************************

	Limit frame rate to vertical refresh by default if compiled with GLEW
and GLX_SGI_swap_control is available. Otherwise, maxfps set to 30.
	--nice eliminated and made default. nanosleep/usleep are much better 
behaved these days.
	spirographx modified to use vertex arrays and GNU extension sincosf if
available, dropping CPU usage significantly.
	Minor updates to correct issues noted by newer compilers.
	--disable-debug is now the default in configure.

******************************* Version 0.8.1 *********************************

	Pulled in vroot.h patch from Ari Pollak's Debian package.
	Added missing #include <assert.h> to hyperspace.cpp
	Image loading in matrixview was hanging for whatever reason,
		rewritten with the new Magick Wand interface.
	ImageMagick now required.
	timeval to double conversion now fixed with an explicit cast of tv_sec
		to double.
	Fixed automake files to use CLEANFILES
	Dropped SSE/3dnow stuff
	Fixed hyperspace.xml typo in dist_kdessconfig_DATA

******************************* Version 0.8.0 *********************************

	Rough sync against new Windows release, rssavers 0.1
		Except for skyrocket
		Added new saver Hyperspace

******************************* Version 0.7.6 *********************************

	Fix to matrixview.c where the body of a thread was accidentally left as a
subfunction of a function that exits while the thread is still alive.

	Added an autoconf check for ExportImagePixels since it was very recently
added (5.5.7).

******************************* Version 0.7.5 *********************************

	Removed multiline strings that are no longer supported by gcc 3.3.

	Added spirographx, a port of an OSX app/screensaver SpirographX by 
Holmes Futrell <holmes@neatosoftware.com>.
	http://homepage.mac.com/solidmag/spiro/

	Added matrixview, based on Alex Zolotov's Matrix GL. Hacked in external 
image loading and ability to modify the resolution of the matrix.

******************************* Version 0.7.4 *********************************

	Fixed bug in lattice when the variable passed to acos would be slightly
greater than 1, causing cascading nan's that made the program useless.

	Explicitly clearing buffers to avoid garbage in blurring modes.

	Lots of stupid little bug fixes.

******************************* Version 0.7.3 *********************************

	Added trails and blur options to flocks. Also added presets to spruce
things up in combination with random preset selection when running 
unconfigured.

	Fixed another cpu detection bug, damn off by one errors :)

	Added support for decimal integer arguments to -window-id. 

	Added .desktop files for preliminary support of KDE. Not sure where
the default directory is, but if it isn't specified by --with-kdessconfigdir,
the configure script checks for the existence of:

/usr/share/applnk/System/ScreenSavers

******************************* Version 0.7.2 *********************************

	Fixed bug in cpu detection code.

	Fixed a bug that included audio data in skyrocket when OpenAL wasn't 
found.

******************************* Version 0.7.1 *********************************

	Fixed a typo crashing skyrocket on big endian machines. Spotted by
Michel Danzer.

	Two new savers: biof and busyspheres.

	New texture smooth for colorfire.

	Fixed a bug that left screensavers running after they should have quit.

	Replaced compile time cpu feature detection with runtime detection.

******************************* Version 0.7.0 *********************************

	Extracted all binary data from the source into binary files. The
source distribution has gotten notably smaller as a result. 

	The binary files are now converted during compilation to significantly 
larger source files with escaping instead of base64 type inefficient strings.
The resulting executables have no unnecessary bloat.

	If the bzip2 library is detected on the system, it is used to compress
the binary data before conversion.

	Added --disable-bzip2 flag to configure. This is to give up space in
order to avoid a delay while decompressing, which is noticeable in skyrocket
that has about 3MB of compressed textures and audio.

	Added --disable-sound flag to configure. This chops off about 3.3MB
(before compression) of audio from skyrocket and any runtime overhead
associated with sound. Useful if you intend to keep passing volume = 0 to
skyrocket.

	Added SSE/3DNow optimized code that gives euphoria a nice 10% boost
on my P4, probably a bit more on an Athlon but I haven't had recent console 
access to one. I'm new at this, so there is probably room for more improvement,
but this is probably good news to those that use euphoria for wallpaper :)
	--disable-(sse|3dnow) nukes the code if you wish to build all 
encompassing binaries.

	Added xscreensaver-demo config files provided by Curtis Haas 
<WonderBoy5150@hotmail.com>.

	More intelligent library linking via a patch provided by Alan Swanson
<swanson@uklinux.net>.

******************************* Version 0.6.8 *********************************

	Terry Walsh (the original author) pointed out a bug causing the camera
not to rotate in Lattice.

	Fixes to make Sun's compilers content.

	Removed original rate limiter in plasma that caused banding when
running full screen on my machine (dual 1.7Ghz P4 Xeon w/ GF4 Ti4400).

	Some other plasma cleanups.

	Reorganized much of driver.c

	Added hack_cleanup to handle things that might not automatically be
freed on exit. Currently just deleting GL lists that might help some people
using DRI.

	Added a signal handler to deal with exiting in fullscreen mode by 
hitting CTRL-C and some other common signals.

******************************* Version 0.6.7 *********************************

	Fixed a relatively harmless bug where the smoke textures in SkyRocket
were missing 48 bytes.

	Rearranged command line argument processing to avoid unportable
rescanning of argv with getopt.

	Now dynamically allocating the largest of the static arrays within
SkyRocket's initWorld function to fix a SIGSEGV on FreeBSD -current.

	No longer relying on RAND_MAX, which is not 2^31 - 1 on Solaris 9 w/
gcc 3.2 from sunfreeware.com.

	Made autoconf a bit smarter to find openal on FreeBSD.

	Stopped including unistd.h if including getopt.h to avoid a compilation
error on FreeBSD w/ the GNU getopt port installed.

	Fixed garbled sound on big endian machines by swapping pairs of bytes
in the embedded audio samples.

	Now intercepting WM_DELETE_WINDOW and exiting properly, I think :)

******************************* Version 0.6.6 *********************************

	The final Really Slick Screensaver has been ported, SkyRocket! :)

	Parameter randomizing on certain screensavers to spruce things up a bit.

	--nice :) For you number crunchers, --nice uses select() to idle
between frames. It also uses select() idling in the fps limiting delay loop for
--maxfps, but don't expect to get exactly, or anywhere near, the specified fps.

	Before you say anything, I know about usleep and nanosleep. Its even in
the code, just commented out. select() seems to just do a better job, for
example w/ -x 128, I get 50/50/100fps using usleep/nanosleep/select in the fps
limiting delay loop.

	Some flocks options were changed to facilitate having --nice/-n.

	I've decided to start scouring the net for cool OpenGL saver material
originally written for Windows. The first four I've found, loved and ported
are: 

	colorfire
	hufo_smoke
	hufo_tunnel
	sundancer2

	If you spot any with source, shoot me a link. If the source isn't 
available, try politely asking for it :)

******************************* Version 0.6.1 *********************************

	All the savers should now include both time.h and sys/time.h...
originally I had opted to only include one because of the following ominous
sounding check in autoconf:

checking whether time.h and sys/time.h may both be included... yes

	But some installations (w/ gcc 2.95.x for example) need both, and I see
xscreensaver, which compiles on every platform I would concern myself with, 
includes both as well.

	Mild tweaks to configure.in and #includes to support FreeBSD.

******************************* Version 0.6.0 *********************************

	Threw in my first attempt at autoconf.

	Removed dependency on GNU getopt_long. Every option should have a
semi-logical short option that is always available.

	Built successfully on a Solaris 8 machine w/ gcc 3.2. It was a shell
server @NYU... if anyone on a desktop SPARC can actually run these before I 
get Solaris back on my Ultra 60, drop me a line.

	Included a tweaked version of debian packaging rules contributed by 
Serge Koenigsmann <serge@koenigsmann.de>

	Support -window-id for previewing in xscreensaver-demo.

	All 9 programs now have basic man pages reflecting the information on
the Windows config panels for these screensavers.

	Pressing f in window mode now outputs fps to stdout.

	--maxfps/-x <arg> now sets maximum fps to <arg>. This helps flux, which
just seemed to be running too fast on my desktop to have its effect. I'm using
busy waiting for now since I am not aware of a way of yielding control without
things getting choppy. nanosleep doesn't quite deliver on Linux/i386.

******************************* Version 0.5.1 *********************************

	Added Q/q/^C in addition to ESC to quit in windowed mode per request.

	Added -h as an alias for --help per request.

	Added vroot.h to driver.c to fix problem with xscreensaver reported by 
	ZlatkO on freshmeat.net

	A few minor bug fixes and changes.

******************************* Version 0.5.0 *********************************

06/25/02 was a momentous day in Unix screensaver history. At least I think so. 
The Really Slick Screensavers were open sourced under GPL. 

Included in this package (version 0.5) are ports of the following 9 screen
savers:

	helios
	euphoria
	solarwinds
	lattice
	flux
	plasma
	fieldlines
	flocks
	cyclone

to GLX. Euphoria and Lattice had been ported to C for inclusion with
XScreenSaver, which is entirely C, but licensing issues kept that from 
happening. So, after being asked by a few people, I created this standalone 
package. The other 7 screensavers were ported relatively quickly since I could
leave them as C++.

This release (0.5) can be considered an early beta port. I've never released
a complete package before, so for now its just static makefiles. They 
sucessfully build this package on a Debian machine tracking unstable.

The source code itself is a bit disorganized, since, in the author's words,
they were written more as art projects than programming projects. I'll be
cleaning it up in later releases, especially if I get reports on portability
to non-x86 or non-Linux OSes.
