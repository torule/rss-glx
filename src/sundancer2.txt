6: Sundancer Inc. Saver[2] 2.1
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  welcome to the new screen saver from
  Sundancer Inc. - Saver[2].

  Saver[2] was completely rewritten so that
  you now have a nice saver with a cool and
  simple interface. all attributes of the
  saver can easily be changed with just a
  klick and some bashing on the keys.


5: Installation
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^
  copy the files 'sundancer[2].scr' and   
  'sundancer[2].ini' in your windows
  directory (eg. 'c:\windows'). now the
  saver should be in your screen saver list.


4: Requirements
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^
  PC, Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4, 2000, XP
  or some windows like that, 
  OpenGL compatible gfx card.


3: Attributes
   ^^^^^^^^^^
  the attributes should be pretty obvious
  except the 'safe mode'. activate it if
  you encounter problems under NT, 2000
  or XP.


2: Disclaimer
   ^^^^^^^^^^
  if something screws up and your machine
  blows, you may blame microsoft but not us.
  use this saver at your own risk!
